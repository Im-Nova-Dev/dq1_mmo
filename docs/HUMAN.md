## What is this?

A multiplayer **Dragon Quest I–style** game:

- Account + hero (starting gold + **3 herbs**)
- Shared **town / field / dungeon** on one map
- Server-side combat (attack, magic, flee, herbs)
- Town **inn** and **field magic**
- Chat: **global**, **nearby**, **zone**, **whisper**, and **system** (level-ups · zone-enter · fights · defeats)
- Emotes, **look**, **`/find`**, **`/who`** · **`/players`** · **`/near`** · **`/zone`**, **`/roll`**, **`/ignore`**, **`/r`** reply, online roster (idle/AFK), status sheet (**F** / `/status`)
- Join toast with **online count** when you enter the world
- Shop, gear (through Full Plate / Silver Shield · sell-back toasts), **bag limits** (12 kinds · 8 each · **D** discard), swappable PNG art
- Up to **3 heroes** per account (create / delete)

**Not in the MVP:** parties, PvP, trade, quests, multi-map worlds.

---

## First session

1. Start the server · run `love client` (see [README](../README.md))
2. Register · create a hero · **Enter World**
3. You spawn in **town** (safe — no random fights)
4. A **welcome** toast shows how many heroes are online

Hero select: **N** new · **D** delete (confirm **Y**) · max 3 heroes.

---

## Zones

| Zone | Notes |
|:-----|:------|
| **Town** | Shop · **inn (R)** · no random encounters |
| **Field** | Random encounters |
| **Water** | Blocked |
| **Dungeon** | Harder fights · **Outside** spell exits to the field |

Your current zone shows as a **ZONE** badge on the HUD and on the **F** status sheet.  
Use **`/zone`** (or **`/where`**) anytime for your area, map position, **who is in the same zone**, and how many heroes are in town / field / dungeon.  
When someone nearby walks from town → field (or similar), you may see a short **system** line: *“Name entered the field.”*  
When a nearby hero starts a fight: *“Name is fighting!”* · if they fall: *“Name was defeated!”*  
**`/who`** (or **O**) also shows online + zone counts.

---

## Combat

Menu: **Attack** · **Flee** · **Spells** · **Herb (H)**.

- Defeat → respawn in town, **lose half your gold** (shown as gold lost), partial HP
- Disconnect mid-fight: about **60 seconds** to reconnect and resume

---

## Inn

Press **R** in town for full HP/MP.

- Cost: **max(4, level × 4)** gold  
- If you can’t afford it, the client shows how much you need

---

## Field magic

| Key | Action |
|:---:|:-------|
| **H** | Heal / Healmore (if known) |
| **M** | Cycle field spells (Return, Repel, Outside, Radiant, …) |
| **K** | List field + battle spells you know |

| Spell | Effect |
|:------|:-------|
| **Return** | Warp to town |
| **Repel** | Fewer random fights (HUD: remaining steps) |
| **Radiant** | Soft light — fewer dungeon fights for a while (HUD: **light N**) |
| **Outside** | Leave dungeon → field |
| **Fairy Water** | Same idea as Repel (item) |

---

## Items

| Item | Effect |
|:-----|:-------|
| **Herb** | Heal (world + battle) |
| **Wings** | Warp to town |
| **Fairy Water** | Temporary repel |

In inventory: **Enter** uses consumables or equips gear (don’t equip herbs — use them).  
**Tab** opens the shop list in town.  
**Herbs** at full HP on the field are not consumed.  
You can **sell equipped** gear (the slot clears automatically).  
Shop listings show **buy** and **sell-back** prices (sell is half of buy).  
Your bag also shows each item’s **sell** value so you know what **S** will earn.  
After **buying** or **selling**, you see a toast with gold spent or gained.  
If you can’t afford an item, the toast shows **how much gold you need**.  
Helmets for sale include **Leather Helmet**, **Iron Helmet**, and **Dragon’s Scale**.  
Weapons include up through **Broad Sword**; armor includes **Half Plate** and **Full Plate**; shields up through **Silver Shield**.  
You cannot open the **shop** (or buy/sell) while in combat.  
Your bag holds up to **12** kinds of items, **8** of each (DQ-style limit). Buying more shows *stack full* or *inventory full*.  
Press **D** in the bag to **discard** one unit of the selected item (frees space; cannot undo).

## Social

| Key / command | Effect |
|:--------------|:-------|
| **T** | Open chat (global channel) |
| **Y** | Open chat (nearby) |
| **/say message** · **/s message** | Nearby chat (same as **Y**) |
| **/g message** · **/global message** | Global chat |
| **/w Name message** | Whisper (private); also `/tell` |
| **/z message** | Zone chat — everyone in the same zone type (town / field / dungeon) |
| **/emote wave** · **/e wave** | Emote by name (also **E** cycles) |
| **/roll** · **/dice** · **/roll 20** | Nearby dice roll (default d100) |
| **E** | Cycle emotes (wave, bow, cheer, dance, …) |
| **F** | Status sheet — refreshes from server (stats, gear, EXP, spells, zone, buffs) |
| **/status** or **/me** | Same status sheet via chat |
| **/find Name** | Search who’s online by name prefix (zone type only — no positions) |
| **/find Name zone:field** | Same, limited to town / field / dungeon |
| **/find zone:town** | List everyone in that zone (still no map positions) |
| **/help** or **?** | Server list of commands / keys |
| **/ignore Name** | Mute chat/emotes from that hero |
| **/unignore Name** | Stop ignoring |
| **/ignores** | List who you are ignoring (names stay if they log off) |
| **/who** | Online / nearby + zone counts (same as **O**) |
| **/players** | Same as `/who` |
| **/near** · **/here** | List heroes nearby (view range) |
| **/zone** · **/where** | Your zone, map position, **who is here**, population by area |
| **/r message** | Reply to the last whisper you got (works even after a brief reconnect) |
| **/** | Open chat ready for a slash command |
| **O** or **P** / **Tab** | Who’s online · nearby list *(zone counts on who)* · `/players` same as `/who` |
| **L** | Look at a nearby (or roster) adventurer |
| **C** | Toggle chat panel |

**HUD:** nearby · online · **repel N** · **light N** (Radiant) when active.  
**F** status sheet: level, EXP (+ to next), gold, **zone**, **your map position** (x, y), repel/light steps, ATK/DEF bonuses, gear, spells.  
**Online roster** (O / player list) shows names/levels, zone type, ⚔ in combat, idle/AFK — **not** map positions for online list.  
Nearby list still shows coordinates for people you can see.  
**`/zone`** also lists heroes currently in the **same zone type** as you (names & levels — not map coordinates of others).  
Roster updates also keep **town / field / dungeon** counts so you can see where people are gathering.

Your own chat and emotes always appear once in your log (global, nearby, and zone).  
Failed whispers (yourself offline, etc.) do not block the next message you try to send.

Chat tags in the log:

| Tag | Meaning |
|:----|:--------|
| *(none / accent)* | Global |
| `[near]` | Nearby (in view range) |
| `[zone]` | Same zone type |
| `[w]` | Whisper |
| `[*]` | System (nearby level-up · zone-enter) |

Only **online** characters can be whispered (by name: `/w Name message`).  
**`/find`** never reveals map positions — only names, levels, combat flag, and **zone type** (town/field/dungeon).  
Filter with **`zone:town`**, **`zone:field`**, or **`zone:dungeon`** (also `in:field`).  
Bare **`/find zone:town`** lists all online heroes in town. Invalid zone names are rejected with an error.

## Art (swap anytime)

Game loads PNGs under `client/assets/`. **File names are the contract.**

| Folder | What |
|:-------|:-----|
| `tiles/` | Map tiles (field, wall, town, water, dungeon) |
| `sprites/heroes/` | You + other players |
| `sprites/enemies/` | One PNG per enemy id (`slime.png`, …) |
| `svg/enemies/` | Optional vector templates (game uses PNG) |

Current placeholders are **CC0** pixel art ([Kenney](https://kenney.nl) + [Tiny Creatures](https://opengameart.org/content/tiny-creatures)).  
Drop your own art over those files and restart Love2D. Full names & licenses → [ATTRIBUTION.md](../client/assets/ATTRIBUTION.md).

```bash
# regenerate from open packs (optional)
python3 tools/import_open_assets.py --download
```

---

## Hosting (operators)

```bash
cd server && source .venv/bin/activate && ./run.sh
```

| Check | |
|:------|:--|
| Health | `GET /health` — `status`, `online`, **`zones`** (town/field/dungeon), `combats` |
| API docs | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` |

**Production checklist**

- Strong `SECRET_KEY`
- `ENV=production`
- `ALLOW_DEBUG=0`
- Durable `DATABASE_URL` path
- Tight `CORS_ORIGINS`

Env vars are listed in the [root README](../README.md#-configuration) and `.env.example`.

## Multiplayer on one PC

```bash
./tools/mp_sim.sh              # headless bots
./tools/mp_love.sh 2           # two Love2D windows
```

Automated tests (for contributors):

```bash
cd server && source .venv/bin/activate && python tests/run_tests.py
# expect: 209 passed
```

## Humans vs agents

| Audience | Docs | What belongs here |
|:---------|:-----|:------------------|
| **You (human)** | This file + [README](../README.md) | Install, controls, gameplay, hosting, art swap |
| **Coding agents / LLMs** | [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) **only** | WebSocket protocol, reliability rules, test matrix |

| Do | Don’t |
|:---|:------|
| Link to AGENTS if a developer needs the protocol | Paste protocol tables into this guide |
| Keep slash-commands accurate (`/w` `/z` `/say` `/g` `/roll` `/find` `/who` `/players` `/near` `/zone` `/ignore` `/status`) | Document unfinished features as shipped |
