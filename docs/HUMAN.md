For **people**: players, operators, and human contributors.  
Coding agents use **[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) only** — you do **not** need that file to play or host.  
Protocol tables and test matrices stay **out** of this guide.

**Version:** 0.5.140 · **724** tests · matches `server/config.py` → `VERSION`

**Recent for players/ops (v0.5.140):** **`/cancel`** clears your meetup invite (and their pending pointer) · muted guests are not spammed · share still soft-reconnects · **724** tests.

> [!TIP]
> **Share your spot:** **`/share Hero`** (or after **`/askwhere`**, they **`/share @last`**) — they get zone + coords; you see near/far. Soft reconnect keeps **@share** / **@from**.  
> **Thank someone:** **`/thank Hero`** or **`/ty @from`** after a share — you see near/far (and zone); they get a private thanks. Failed delivery refunds chat rate and restores AFK.  
> **Poke a friend:** **`/poke Hero`** or **`/nudge @last`** — you see near/far (and zone); they get a private “trying to get your attention.” Failed delivery won’t leave you stuck rate-limited or wrongly AFK.  
> **Find friends:** **`/find Hero`** · **`/find zone:field`** · **`/find combat:yes`** — you get a plain line (how many matched · how many online), never someone else’s map coords.  
> **Step away cleanly:** **`/afk lunch`** · **`/back`**. **Mute:** **`/ignore`** · **`/ignores`** · **`/unignore`**.

---

## First session

1. Start the server · run `love client` (see [README](../README.md))
2. Register · create a hero (clothes + **3 herbs** + gold) · **Enter World**
3. You spawn in **town** (safe — no random fights)
4. A **welcome** toast shows how many heroes are online

Hero select: **N** new · **D** delete (confirm **Y**) · max 3 heroes.

---

## Zones

| Zone | Notes |
|:-----|:------|
| **Town** | Shop · **inn (R)** · no random encounters |
| **Field** | Random encounters |
| **Water** | Blocked |
| **Dungeon** | Harder fights · **Outside** spell exits to the field |

Your current zone shows as a **ZONE** badge on the HUD and on the **F** status sheet.  
Use **`/zone`** (or **`/where`**) anytime for your area, map position, **who is in the same zone**, and how many heroes are in town / field / dungeon.  
When someone nearby walks from town → field (or similar), you may see a short **system** line: *“Name entered the field.”*  
When a nearby hero starts a fight: *“Name is fighting!”*  
Battle ends nearby: *“was victorious!”* · *“fled battle!”* · *“was defeated!”*  
Someone AFK long enough may show as **went idle** when they leave your view.  
**`/who`** (or **O**) and **`/counts`** show online + zone totals.

---

## Combat

Menu: **Attack** · **Flee** · **Spells** · **Herb (H)**.

- Defeat → respawn in town, **lose half your gold** (shown as gold lost), partial HP
- Disconnect mid-fight: about **60 seconds** to reconnect and resume

---

## Inn

Press **R** in town to **see the inn cost**, then **R again** (within a few seconds) to rest and pay.

- Cost: **max(4, level × 4)** gold (free if already full HP/MP)  
- If you can’t afford it, the quote shows how much you need  
- Slash: **`/inn`** or **`/rest`** also requests a cost quote

---

## Field magic

| Key | Action |
|:---:|:-------|
| **H** | Heal / Healmore (if known) |
| **M** | Cycle field spells (Return, Repel, Outside, Radiant, …) |
| **K** | List field + battle spells you know |

| Spell | Effect |
|:------|:-------|
| **Return** | Warp to town |
| **Repel** | Fewer random fights (HUD: remaining steps) |
| **Radiant** | Soft light — fewer dungeon fights for a while (HUD: **light N**) |
| **Outside** | Leave dungeon → field |
| **Fairy Water** | Same idea as Repel (item) |

---

## Items

| Item | Effect |
|:-----|:-------|
| **Herb** | Heal (world + battle) |
| **Wings** | Warp to town |
| **Fairy Water** | Temporary repel |

In inventory: **Enter** uses consumables or equips gear (don’t equip herbs — use them).  
**Tab** opens the shop list in town.  
**Herbs** at full HP on the field are not consumed.  
You can **sell equipped** gear (the slot clears automatically).  
Shop listings show **buy** and **sell-back** prices (sell is half of buy).  
Your bag also shows each item’s **sell** value so you know what **S** will earn.  
After **buying** or **selling**, you see a toast with gold spent or gained.  
If you can’t afford an item, the toast shows **how much gold you need**.  
Helmets for sale include **Leather Helmet**, **Iron Helmet**, and **Dragon’s Scale**.  
Weapons include up through **Broad Sword**; armor includes **Half Plate** and **Full Plate**; shields up through **Silver Shield**.  
You cannot open the **shop** (or buy/sell) while in combat.  
Your bag holds up to **12** kinds of items, **8** of each (DQ-style limit). Buying more shows *stack full* or *inventory full*.  
Press **D** in the bag to **discard** one unit of the selected item (frees space; cannot undo).

| **/last** · **/lastwhisper** | See who **/r** will reply to (near/far when online) |
| **/** | Open chat ready for a slash command |
| **O** or **P** / **Tab** | Who’s online · nearby list *(zone counts on who)* · `/players` same as `/who` |
| **L** · **/look** · **/look Name** | Look at a nearby or online adventurer — alone, looks at yourself · far targets show zone only (no map coords) |
| **C** | Toggle chat panel |

**HUD:** nearby · online · **repel N** · **light N** (Radiant) when active.  
**F** status sheet: level, EXP (+ to next), gold, **zone**, **your map position** (x, y), repel/light steps, ATK/DEF bonuses, gear, spells.  
**Online roster** (O / player list) shows names/levels, zone type, ⚔ in combat, idle/AFK — **not** map positions for online list.  
Nearby list still shows coordinates for people you can see.  
**`/zone`** also lists heroes currently in the **same zone type** as you (names & levels — not map coordinates of others).  
Roster updates also keep **town / field / dungeon** counts so you can see where people are gathering.

Your own chat and emotes always appear once in your log (global, nearby, and zone).  
Failed whispers and private social messages (yourself, offline targets, or a dropped connection) do **not** block the next message you try to send — and if you were AFK, your AFK badge stays on after a failed delivery.  
If someone invited you and then went offline, **`/accept`** or **`/decline`** clears that stuck invite so you are not stuck forever.

**Brief disconnects (~1 minute):** your **mute list**, **last whisper partner** (full near/far card so **`/r`** still works), **share partners** (`@share` / `@from`), **emote partners** (`@emote` / `@emotedby`), **meetup invite peers** (`/pending` / `/lastinvite`), and **Repel / Radiant** buffs come back when you rejoin — and your **`/played`** timer keeps counting. The welcome toast may list what was restored (including **session timer** for `/played`). Other players see a cleaner join/leave when someone reconnects.  
Chatting, whispering, emoting, or **walking** clears your **AFK** badge for people nearby. **Zone chat** only works while you are in town, field, or dungeon.

**Two-way social memory (plain language):** after you **`/share`**, **`/wave`**, or **`/invite`**, partners are remembered when possible — and a brief disconnect keeps them. Always type the **`@`**.

| Shortcut | Points to | Survives soft reconnect? |
|:---------|:----------|:-------------------------|
| **`@share`** | who *you* last shared your spot with | yes |
| **`@from`** | who last shared *their* spot with you | yes |
| **`@emote`** | who *you* last waved / emoted at | yes |
| **`@emotedby`** | who last waved / emoted *at you* | yes |
| **`@last`** | last whisper / social peer (command-specific) | yes (whisper) |
| **`@pending`** | pending meetup invite peer | yes |

Handy: **`/lastshare`** · **`/lastemote`** · **`/lastinvite`** · **`/social`** · **`/pending`**.  
Example: **`/w @emotedby hi`** · **`/thank @from`** · **`/wave @emote`**.

Chat tags in the log:

| Tag | Meaning |
|:----|:--------|
| *(none / accent)* | Global |
| `[near]` | Nearby (in view range) |
| `[zone]` | Same zone type |
| `[w]` | Whisper |
| `[*]` | System (nearby level-up · zone-enter) |

Only **online** characters can be whispered (`/w Name message`). A **unique prefix** of the name is enough; if several players match, you get an error instead of a wrong target.  
**`/find`** never reveals map positions — only names, levels, combat flag, **zone type**, and AFK — never map coordinates of others.  
Filter with **`zone:town`**, **`zone:field`**, or **`zone:dungeon`** (also `in:field`).  
Bare **`/find zone:town`** lists all online heroes in town. Invalid zone names are rejected with an error.  
Whispering someone who is AFK still delivers the message; you get a short note that they may be away (and their reason, if they set one).

## Humans vs agents

| Audience | Docs | What belongs here |
|:---------|:-----|:------------------|
| **You (human)** | This file + [README](../README.md) | Install, controls, gameplay, hosting, art swap |
| **Coding agents / LLMs** | [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) **only** | WebSocket protocol, reliability rules, test matrix |

You do **not** need agent docs to play or host.  
Agents should **not** copy protocol tables into this guide.  
Live version badges above match `server/config.py` → `VERSION` (**0.5.140** · **724** tests).

| Do | Don’t |
|:---|:------|
| Link to AGENTS if a developer needs the protocol | Paste protocol tables into this guide |
| Keep slash-commands accurate (`/w` `/askwhere` `/thank` `/share` `/cast` `/buy` `/stuck` …) | Document unfinished features as shipped |
| Use plain language for players | Leak message-type catalogs or test matrices |

Index & rules → [docs/README.md](README.md)
